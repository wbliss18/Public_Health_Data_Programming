Term Project: Mental and Physical Health Among US Veterans: Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System 2020

Abstract

Background

The department of Veteran Affairs has requested $269.9 billion in funds from the United States government for fiscal year 2022 (Office of Budget). With this much money being handled by the VA, is the money being properly used to help veterans struggling with their mental and physical health? Thus, this research will look to see if veteran status has a significant impact on an individual’s mental and physical health. 

Method
The 2020 BRFSS survey had 401,958 respondents. Of these people, 111,321 participants reported “no” to having poor health in the last 30 days, and 50,027 said “yes”. As for veteran status, 351,210 non-veterans took the survey and 48,221 veterans took the survey. 

Results

Table 2 shows that 8,930 (44%) veterans reported having poor health in the last 30 days, whereas a larger portion of non-veterans, 11,236 (56%), said that they had not struggled with poor health in the last 30 days. This is the opposite of what I was expecting, as it shows that veterans reported poor health less often. However, this distribution had a Chi-Square p-value above 0.05. Table 3 shows an adjusted odds ratio 1.0720 for veteran status, but the p-value is above 0.05. 

Conclusion

After looking at Table 2, Table 3, and Table 4, it can be seen that the veteran variable does not have a p-value below 0.05 for any type of test. Thus, veteran status does not have a significant impact on an individual’s combination of mental and physical health in this data.
